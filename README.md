# Word chains

program that solves word-chain puzzles.

There’s a type of puzzle where the challenge is to build a chain of words, starting with one particular
word and ending with another. Successive entries in the chain must all be real words, and each can differ 
from the previous word by just one letter. For example, you can get from “cat” to “dog” using the following chain.

cat > cot > cog > dog
